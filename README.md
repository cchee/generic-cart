# generic-cart

This is a generic web app template using Ionic with React.

These are the steps taken to setup this project initially:

- npm install -g @ionic/cli
- ionic start generic-cart --type react blank

To run the generic-cart after checkout from GIT:

- cd generic-cart
- ionic serve

## Developer's Notes

In React properties are being passed down the component tree to facilitate data synchronization between components within the tree

## Disclaimer

This is my first attempt to do typescript based UI
